# Algorithm and Data Structures

A collection of JavaScript implementations for learning algorithms and data structures concepts.

## Setup

This project uses JavaScript files that can be executed using the Code Runner extension in VS Code.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed on your system
- VS Code with Code Runner extension

### Running Scripts
1. Open any `.js` file in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Alt+N` (or `Cmd+Alt+N` on Mac) to run the script
3. Or right-click and select "Run Code"
