# Data Structures

## Comparisons with Arrays

### Lists

- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a next pointer
- Random access is not allowed

### Arrays

- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be accessed at a specific index


## Singly Linked List

Linked list is a connection of nodes

### Big O Notation of Singly Linked List

Insertion = O(1)
Removal = O(1) or O(N)
Searching = O(N)
Access = O(N)
